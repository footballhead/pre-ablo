DirectDraw Init FAILED
===============================================================================

After tracking down DPLAY.DLL, this is probably the second error you'll come across.

I haven't been able to get this running natively on Windows 10. I'd recommend this DirectDraw patch: http://www.strangebytes.com/index.php/projects/1-diablo-1-windows-7-vista-patch

Download, extract, then copy ddraw.dll to the same directory as DIABLO.EXE
