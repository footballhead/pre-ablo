Missing Caves Graphics
===============================================================================

`levels/l3data` is missing from the MPQ. The retail files work in a pinch.

To install: copy `levels` into the folder that contains DIABLO.EXE.

Known issues:

* The minimap doesn't 100% work, see https://gitlab.com/moralbacteria/diablo-prdemo-patches/-/issues/7
* The graphics don't look 100% correct, see https://gitlab.com/moralbacteria/diablo-prdemo-patches/-/issues/11
