    <description>A workaround to prevent the game from crashing when using Stone Curse. Specifically, this prevents drawing overlapping missiles. While this causees graphical glitches for a lot of spells (e.g. Flash, Mana Shield, Town Portal, ...) it's better than crashing since Stone Curse is highly recommended for later dungeon levels.</description>
