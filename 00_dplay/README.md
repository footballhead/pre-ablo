DPLAY.DLL was not found
===============================================================================

Running DIABLO.EXE will most likely show this error dialog:

> The code execution cannot proceed because DPLAY.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem. 

The Pre-Release Demo contains early netcode (even though it's mostly unused) that is built on DirectPlay. Given the binary date of 8/16/1996, it's either DirectX 1 or 2.

Locate a DirectX 2 installer (e.g. http://www.oldversion.com/windows/download/directx-2-0). Extract the zip, find DPLAY.DLL, and copy to the same directory as DIABLO.EXE
