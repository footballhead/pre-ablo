Missing Rogue Graphics
===============================================================================

The Rogue class graphics are missing. Fortunately, Alpha4 has already converted the missing files from retail CL2 to PR Demo CEL. Thanks to Diablo Evolution, check them out: https://diablo-evolution.net/index.php?pageid=alpha4

To install: copy `plrgfx` into the folder that contains DIABLO.EXE, merging with anything already there.
