    <description>Enables a developer debug mode. This does the following:

- All monsters are Skeletons with axes (except for setlevels like Skeleton King Lair and Bone Chamber, or the Butcher)
- Cheats: On/Off replaces Music: On/Off in the game menu. Hold CTRL+SHIFT when clicking to toggle.
- Bunch of developer related keyboard functions
- All normal quests are active (Butcher, Skeleton King, Magic Rock, Bone Chamber)

When cheats are on:

- Everything in the cheat patch
- You have access to all spells, each is level 0
- All quests are in the quest log, even The Maze (level 4 stairs blocker that requires reading the Tome)</description>
