    <description>Enable the old Alpha DRLG for the cathedral levels 1-4.

Known issues:

- The Tome does not generate on dlvl 4, which means you cannot progress to the catacombs. It is assumed that this should work so this will be fixed at some point.
- The entrance to the Skeleton King's Lair does not generate on dlvl 3. It is assumed that this wasn't implemented at this point in development so this will not be fixed.</description>
